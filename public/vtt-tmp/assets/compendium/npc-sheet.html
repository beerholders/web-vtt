            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
            <p><strong>Bite.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Claw.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Tail.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Frightful Presence.</strong> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).</strong> The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="legendary-actions">
            <h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
            <p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
            <p><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
            <p><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
            <p><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="lair-actions">
            <h3>Lair Actions</h3>
            <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
                <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
                <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="regional-effects">
            <h3>Regional Effects</h3>
            <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
                <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
                <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
