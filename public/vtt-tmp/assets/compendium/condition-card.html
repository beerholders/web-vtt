                <li>A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.</li>
                <li>The creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
                <li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
                <li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
                <li>The creature has resistance to all damage.</li>
                <li>The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</li>
